KPI,Brief Description,Current Data Collected,Data Source,Calculation Method,Update Frequency,Shared Data
1. WIP Aging,"Elapsed amount of days the Job has been in-process from their start date before is completed/rejected/cancelled. Note: if marked as defective and then repaired or in-queue for repair, the Aging time is still counting. Note 2: When material is reported on-hold, aging is not longer reported until the material is brought back to production. Tracked by Job or WorkOrder, a job or workorder may be from Qty=1 to different batch size.",Job Planned Start Date OR Job Actual Start Date OR Job First Operation Date,"Logbook (paper), traveler sheet, production schedule excel sheet",now() - date,Daily,"Yes, with on-time-delivery measurements"
2. On-Time Delivery,"Percentage of orders delivered by the promised date, typically means committed ship-date, sometimes adding transit time if receipt date is available. Note: When promised date or required date is not available, then it is calculated by the using the Job size by the Job Allowed Hours (or ideal cycle time), meaning that for a job of 100 units, where the ideal cycle time is equal to 0.25 hrs, versus the shift hours,  then delivery date is calculated as start_date + ceil((100*0.25)/9) ",Job Planned Ship Date OR Job Required Date OR Job Ideal Cycle Time (allowed hours),Production Schedule excel sheet,"count of orders flagged on time / total orders measured
Flagged on time = actual delivery <= promised date (planned or required)
Surrogate Flagged on time = (actual delivery - start date) <= target cycle time OR use calculated delivery date",Daily,"Yes, with WIP Aging"
3. Production Efficiency,"Estimate of effective production time based on staffed line and production output. Ideally clock hours per operator. Where target is 90%
Any number above 100% is misleading and actual product details or staff needs to be verified",Employee attendance manually by line supervisor. Daily production units (hourly in some cases),Production Schedule excel sheet. Attendance logbook,"Hours Produced = Pieces * Standard Time
Hours Available = Employees * Scheduled Production Time","Daily, hourly","Cycle time OR Standard Time OR Allowed Hours with OTD
Production units with Quality metrics"
4. Quality PPM,"Defective units found  per million units produced. Usually reported at final inspection, in some cases reported during the process at any given operation if the product cannot continue or cannot be reworked-repaired","Production throughput, Finished units","Traveler sheets, Production logbook",(Qty of defects / Total units Produced)*1000000,Daily,Quality metrics
5. Quality DPMO,"Defects per million opportunities. Measure defects relative to the number of opportunities for error, not just units","Production throughput, Finished units","Traveler sheets, Production logbook","(Defects/(units * opportunities per unit))*1000000
Opportunities per unit means if the defective unit failed by multiple reasons",Daily,Quality metrics
6. Quality FPY,Percentage of units produced that meet quality standard without repair and without rework,"Production throughput, Finished units","Traveler sheets, Production logbook","Pass Units (no rework, no repair) / Total Units Processed",Daily,Quality metrics
7. Quality RTY,Percentage of units that passes-completes through all process steps and are shippable defect-free,"Production throughput, Finished units","Traveler sheets, Production logbook",Completed Units / Total Units Processed,Daily,Quality metrics
8. Availability,"How much time the line/operation is actually running compared to planned production time (scheduled maintenance, equipment failure, material shortage, setup time, lack of orders, changeover time). Recording duration, reason, responsible. Should be calculated for the entire production line-cell. Meaning that 0.5 hrs down in operation 1, may not impact the entire production line if the other operations were working. So, assuming I had 10 operations, running 9 hrs each, but only one reported 0.5hrs downtime, actual downtime 1-((90-0.5)/90)","Downtime logs by Supervisor, leader",Downtime logbook,1 - ((uptime hours - downtime hours) / planned production time),Daily,OEE metrics
9. Performance,"How fast the material is flowing thru the line compared to its designed-ideal speed or setup configuration. Make sure to use Ideal Cycle Time and Run Time with the same units (seconds, minutes, hours). Make sure to use correct total count number for units processed for the specified run time, if partial floor the number.","Production throughput, Finished units","Traveler sheets, Production logbook",(Ideal Cycle Time * Total Count Processed)/ Run Time,"Daily, hourly",OEE metrics
10. Absenteeism,Percentage of scheduled work time the employee miss. Calculate for the entire line-cell or business unit.,Attendance entry by Supervisor or data collector,Attendance logbook,(Total Absence Hours / Total Scheduled Work Hours) * 100,Daily,Workforce availability
