      # NOTE: Full frontend build verification (npm run build) is intentionally
      # NOT included as a pre-commit hook because it takes 30-60s per commit.
      # Build verification is enforced in CI (ci.yml frontend-lint-and-tests job)
      # which runs `npm run build` BEFORE tests as the first quality gate.
      # Enable branch protection to require CI to pass before merging to main.
